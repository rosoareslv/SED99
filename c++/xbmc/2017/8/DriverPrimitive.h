   * \ingroup joystick
   * \brief Basic driver element associated with input events
   *
   * Driver input (bools, floats and enums) is split into primitives that better
   * map to the physical features on a joystick.
   *
   * A bool obviously only maps to a single feature, so it is a driver
   * primitive. Here, these are called "buttons".
   *
   * A hat enum encodes the state of the four hat directions. Each direction
   * can map to a different feature, so a hat enum consists of four driver
   * primitives called "hat directions".
   *
   * A float is a little trickier. Trivially, it can map to an analog stick or
   * trigger. However, DirectInput combines two triggers onto a single axis.
   * Therefore, the axis is split into two primitives called "semiaxes".
   *
   * The type determines the fields in use:
   *
   *    Button:
   *       - driver index
   *
   *    Hat direction:
   *       - driver index
   *       - hat direction (up/right/down/left)
   *
   *    Semiaxis:
   *       - driver index
   *       - center (-1, 0 or 1)
   *       - semiaxis direction (positive/negative)
   *       - range (1 or 2)
   *
   *    Motor:
   *       - driver index
   *
