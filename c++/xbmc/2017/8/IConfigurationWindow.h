 * \brief Controller configuration window
 *
 * The configuration window presents a list of controllers. Also on the screen
 * is a list of features belonging to that controller.
 *
 * The configuration utility reacts to several events:
 *
 *   1) When a controller is focused, the feature list is populated with the
 *      controller's features.
 *
 *   2) When a feature is selected, the user is prompted for controller input.
 *      This initiates a "wizard" that walks the user through the subsequent
 *      features.
 *
 *   3) When the wizard's active feature loses focus, the wizard is cancelled
 *      and the prompt for input ends.
