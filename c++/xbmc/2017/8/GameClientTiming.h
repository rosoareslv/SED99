   * \brief Class to normalize audio and video timing to avoid audio resampling
   *
   * For example, assume the audio callback supports two sample rates:
   * 32,000 Hz and 44,100 Hz.
   *
   * If the game client reports an audio sample rate of 32040.5, the audio
   * callback will normalize this to 32,000 Hz. The correction factor is then
   * set to (32000 / 32040.5) = 0.9987.
   *
   * After normalization, GetSampleRate() will report (32040.5 * 0.9987) = 32000.
   *
   * If the game client's frame rate is 60.1 fps, after normalization
   * GetFrameRate() will report (60.1 * 0.9987) = 60.024 fps. The game
   * client's frame rate has been slowed slightly to avoid resampling audio.
   *
   * To avoid excessive scaling, normalization will fail if the correction
   * factor exceeds MAX_CORRECTION_FACTOR_PERCENT.
