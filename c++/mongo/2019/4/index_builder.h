/**
 * A helper class for replication to use for building indexes.
 * In standalone mode, we use the client connection thread for building indexes in the
 * background. In replication mode, secondaries must spawn a new thread to build background
 * indexes, since there are no client connection threads to use for such purpose.  IndexBuilder
 * is a subclass of BackgroundJob to enable this use.
 * This class is also used for building indexes in the foreground on secondaries, for
 * code convenience.  buildInForeground() is directly called by the replication applier to
 * build an index in the foreground; the properties of BackgroundJob are not used for this use
 * case.
 * For background index builds, BackgroundJob::go() is called on the IndexBuilder instance,
 * which begins a new thread at this class's run() method.  After go() is called in the
 * parent thread, waitForBgIndexStarting() must be called by the same parent thread,
 * before any other thread calls go() on any other IndexBuilder instance.  This is
 * ensured by the replication system, since commands are effectively run single-threaded
 * by the replication applier.
 * The argument "constraints" specifies whether we should honor or ignore index constraints,
 * The ignoring of constraints is for replication due to idempotency reasons.
 * The argument "replicatedWrites" specifies whether or not this operation should replicate
 * oplog entries associated with this index build.
 * The argument "initIndexTs" specifies the timestamp to be used to make the initial catalog write.
