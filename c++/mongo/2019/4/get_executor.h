/**
 * Get an executor that potentially uses a DISTINCT_SCAN, intended for either a "distinct" command

 *
 * Distinct is unique in that it doesn't care about getting all the results; it just wants all
 * possible values of a certain field.  As such, we can skip lots of data in certain cases (see body
 * of method for detail).
 *
 * A $group stage on a single field behaves similarly to a distinct command. If it has no
 * accumulators or only $first accumulators, the $group command only needs to visit one document for
 * each distinct value of the grouped-by (_id) field to compute its result. When there is a sort
 * order specified in parsedDistinct->getQuery()->getQueryRequest.getSort(), the DISTINCT_SCAN will
 * follow that sort order, ensuring that it chooses the correct document from each group to compute
 * any $first accumulators.
 *
 * Specify the QueryPlannerParams::STRICT_DISTINCT_ONLY flag in the 'params' argument to ensure that
 * any resulting plan _guarantees_ it will return exactly one document per value of the distinct
 * field. Without this flag, getExecutorDistinct() may use a plan that takes advantage of
 * DISTINCT_SCAN to filter some but not all duplicates (so that de-duplication is still necessary
 * after query execution), or it may fall back to a regular IXSCAN.
 *
 * Note that this function uses the projection in 'parsedDistinct' to produce a covered query when
 * possible, but when a covered query is not possible, the resulting plan may elide the projection
 * stage (instead returning entire fetched documents).
 *
 * For example, a distinct query on field 'b' could use a DISTINCT_SCAN over index {a: 1, b: 1}.
 * This plan will reduce the output set by filtering out documents that are equal on both the 'a'
 * and 'b' fields, but it could still output documents with equal 'b' values if their 'a' fields are
 * distinct.
