/**
 * This checks for resumability on a single shard in the sharded case. The rules are
 *
 * - If the first document in the pipeline for this shard has a matching timestamp, we can
 *   always resume.
 * - If the oplog is empty, we can resume.  An empty oplog is rare and can only occur
 *   on a secondary that has just started up from a primary that has not taken a write.
 *   In particular, an empty oplog cannot be the result of oplog truncation.
 * - If neither of the above is true, the least-recent document in the oplog must precede the resume
 *   timestamp. If we do this check after seeing the first document in the pipeline in the shard, or
 *   after seeing that there are no documents in the pipeline after the resume token in the shard,
 *   we're guaranteed not to miss any documents.
 *
 * - Otherwise we cannot resume, as we do not know if this shard lost documents between the resume
 *   token and the first matching document in the pipeline.
 *
 * This source need only run on a sharded collection.  For unsharded collections,
 * DocumentSourceEnsureResumeTokenPresent is sufficient.
