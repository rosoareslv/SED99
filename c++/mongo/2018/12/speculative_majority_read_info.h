/**
 * This structure stores information about a "speculative" majority read. Reads of this nature do
 * not rely on storage engine support for reading from a historical, majority committed snapshot.
 * Instead, they read from a local (uncommitted) snapshot of data, and, at the end of command
 * execution, block to ensure that any results returned are majority committed.
 *
 * For the sake of correctness, it would be fine to always wait on the most recent lastApplied
 * optime after a command completes, but, as an optimization, we also allow commands to choose what
 * optime to wait on. For example, if a command generates a batch of data and it knows that the data
 * doesn't reflect any operations newer than optime T, it can set the "speculative majority optime"
 * to T. If T is much less than lastApplied, this can save unnecessary waiting.
 *
 * The basic theory of operation of this class is that once an operation has been marked as a
 * speculative majority read, it cannot be "unmarked" as such. Trying to mark it as speculative
 * again should have no effect. Once it has been marked as "speculative", a specific optime to wait
 * on can also be optionally provided. This read optime can be set multiple times, but every new
 * optime must be >= the previously set optime. This ensures that clients of this class utilize it
 * sensibly. The goal is to avoid a later caller invalidating the optime set by an earlier caller,
 * by setting the optime backwards. By enforcing the monotonicity of optimes, we ensure that waiting
 * on any read optime of this class will always guarantee that previously set optimes are also
 * majority committed. If no optime is ever set, then a speculative read operation should wait on
 * the most recent, system-wide lastApplied optime after completing.
