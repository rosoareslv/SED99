/// GenXUnbaling
/// ------------
///
/// After live range building, GenXUnbaling spots cases where baling is harmful
/// due to extending the live range of a big vector.
///
/// The need for the unbaling pass
/// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
///
/// A *two address operation* (mainly wrregion, but also a few intrinsics that
/// do a predicated read from a shared function unit such as memory) is one
/// where the result needs to be in the same register as one operand, the *two
/// address operand*. GenXCoalescing attempts to coalesce the two together, but
/// it fails if the live range of the two address operand extends beyond the
/// two address instruction. Failure of coalescing means that you get extra
/// code inserted before to copy the whole big vector, and increased register
/// pressure because two values of the big vector are live at the same time.
///
/// Similarly, with a phi node incoming, GenXCoalescing attempts to coalesce
/// the incoming with the phi node result. Failure means that you get extra
/// code inserted to copy the value at the end of the incoming block.
///
/// The existence of this problem is due to our use of SSA. Both the input and
/// the output of the wrregion (or the phi incoming and result) are probably
/// the same big vector variable in the source code, and a more traditional
/// compiler would treat the variable as a single (non-SSA) value assigned to
/// its own register, avoiding the need to treat the wrregion specially as a
/// two address operation.
///
/// With the traditional approach, code motion is more difficult, as an
/// instruction cannot be moved past any other instruction that modifies any of
/// the potentially moving instruction's uses.
///
/// With our SSA approach, code motion (of an instruction with no memory
/// interaction) is much easier, and we use that in GenXBaling to bale an
/// instruction into another one without needing to check anything in between.
/// (Even though GenXBaling often does not actually move the baled in
/// instruction in IR, it must be treated as if it is at the position of the
/// head of the bale.)
///
/// The price we pay for that flexibility is that sometimes we move code even
/// when it is harmful to do so.
///
/// The most common situation where it would fail to coalesce is where
/// legalization has created a sequence of wrregions, and the "old value" input
/// to the first one is also used in a rdregion baled in to each one of the
/// wrregions.
///
/// Other situations include where some other rdregion use of the two address
/// operand is user code that has been baled to after the instruction, and
/// where the user code actually takes a copy of the big vector and then uses
/// one or more regions out of it after the two address instruction.
///
/// The GenXUnbaling pass implements two transformations: the non-overlapping
/// region optimization, and the unbaling transformation.
///
/// Non-overlapping region optimization
/// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
///
/// A common cause of the two address operand, the "old value" input, of a
/// wrregion extending beyond the wrregion is that the wrregion is the first in
/// a sequence created by GenXLegalization, and the same vector is used as an
/// input to rdregions baled in to subsequent bales in the sequence.
///
/// In this case, a baled in rdregion is reading a part of the vector that has
/// not been overwritten by any earlier wrregion in the sequence.
///
/// The non-overlapping region optimization detects this case by checking which
/// regions of the vector have been overwritten by earlier wrregions in the
/// sequence. If the region read by the rdregion has not been overwritten, then
/// the optimization can change the input to the rdregion to the result of the
/// previous wrregion in the sequence without changing the semantics.
///
/// If this succeeds for all the rdregions from the same vector in the
/// sequence, then the live range no longer reaches beyond the first wrregion
/// and it can be two address coalesced.
///
/// The non-overlapping region optimization also handles a similar case where
/// the "old value" input to the first wrregion in the sequence is undef, but
/// of the same type as the input to rdregions through the sequence. As well as
/// modifying each rdregion input to the result of the previous wrregion, it
/// changes the undef input to the first wrregion to the same input vector.
/// This also stops the live range of the inputs to the rdregions overlapping
/// the result, and thus saves register pressure. However it can make the code
/// worse if there are further uses of the input after the sequence, so it only
/// makes the transformation if there are no further uses.
///
/// Unbaling transformation
/// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
///
/// At its simplest, the unbaling transformation looks at each two address
/// instruction and phi node incoming, and then looks at the uses of the "old
/// value" input:
///
/// * A use before the original two address instruction can be ignored as it
///   does not cause the "old value" input to be live beyond that instruction.
///
/// * A use after the original two address instruction that is not a rdregion
///   cannot be handled, so causes the pass to abandon processing this original
///   two address operation.
///
/// * A rdregion use after the original two address instruction is unbaled so
///   it regains its pre-baling position before the original two address
///   instruction.
///
/// Thus the use of the "old value" input in the two address instruction
/// becomes a kill use, and coalescing at that instruction will succeed. Or the
/// phi incoming becomes a kill use, and coalescing it with the phi result will
/// succeed.
///
/// But there are complications:
///
/// Moving the unbaled instruction
/// """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
///
/// Unbaling an instruction means that its position in the code is now
/// considered to be the same as its position in the IR. Sometimes that is
/// where we want it (before the original two address instruction), since
/// baling tends not to move code. But sometimes it is still after the original
/// two address instruction, most likely because of the order of code split by
/// GenXLegalization.
///
/// Thus we may need to move the unbaled instruction up to before the original
/// two address instruction. In fact we need to move the whole sub-bale (the
/// new bale headed by the instruction we are unbaling). A rdregion can have an
/// llvm.genx.add.address intrinsic baled in if it has a variable index.
///
/// If the unbaled instruction is dominated by the original two address
/// instruction, we move it to just before that. Otherwise, we move it to the
/// end of the basic block that is the nearest common dominator of the two
/// locations.
///
/// To move a bale up, we need to ensure that all outside-bale operands are
/// defined before where we are going to move it to. If that is not the case,
/// then unbaling for the original two address instruction fails.
///
/// Moving when there is a variable index
/// """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
///
/// For a rdregion with a variable index, there is an llvm.genx.conv.address
/// intrinsic, which represents the setting of an address register relative to
/// the base register that the rdregion will access. GenXCategory ensures that
/// there is one llvm.genx.conv.address intrinsic for each variable index
/// rdregion or wrregion, since it does not know which region accesses are
/// going to be in the same register. Commoning up of address conversions is
/// done later, after coalescing has decided which ones are in the same base
/// register.
///
/// The problem for GenXUnbaling is that the llvm.genx.conv.address is likely
/// to be just before the rdregion, which stops the rdregion being moved to
/// before the original two address instruction.
///
/// The solution is to pretend that the llvm.genx.conv.address (and anything it
/// bales in, probably a zext/sext) is part of the rdregion's bale, just for
/// GenXUnbaling's purposes of telling whether it is OK to move it, and then
/// actually moving it. GenXBaling::buildBale() has an extra IncludeAddr flag
/// to enable this behavior.
///
/// What is before and after?
/// """""""""""""""""""""""""
///
/// The notion of whether an instruction is before or after the original two
/// address instruction is more complex in the presence of control flow.
///
/// This pass distinguishes the following cases:
///
/// * Before: The instruction dominates the original two address instruction,
///   so can be considered before it. No use in the instruction reaches back to
///   the original two address instruction.
///
/// * After: The original two address instruction dominates the instruction, so
///   can be considered after it. A use in the instruction causes liveness to
///   reach back to the original two address instruction (as long as the use's
///   definition is before that).
///
/// * Reaches: Neither dominates the other, but a use in the instruction causes
///   liveness to reach back to the original two address instruction anyway.
///   This is determined by actually tracing back all the branches through the
///   control graph, abandoning a branch when it rejoins with another one or
///   reaches the definition.
///
/// * Not reaches: Neither dominates the other, but we can prove that a use in
///   the instruction does not cause liveness to reach back to the original two
///   address instruction.
///
/// When processing a phi incoming rather than a two address instruction, it is
/// considered to be at the end of the corresponding incoming block, rather
/// than at the site of the phi node.
///
/// If we have "not reaches", then the use can be ignored in the same way as a
/// "before" use.
///
/// If we have "reaches", then we can still unbale it. If the new sub-bale
/// needs moving, then we move it to the end of the block that is the nearest
/// common dominator of its old location and the original two address
/// instruction.
///
/// A use in a phi node is considered to be at the end of the incoming block
/// for the purposes of determining its position.
///
/// Commoning up unbaled sub-bales
/// """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
///
/// It is often the case that baling has caused the same rdregion to be cloned
/// (because a baled in instruction can only have a single use), so unbaling
/// the baled in rdregions causes duplicate instructions. No CSE is run after
/// this point, as that would cause various problems including messing up the
/// baling and the address conversion.
///
/// Therefore, this pass needs to spot when it is unbaling duplicate sub-bales
/// and common them up.
///
/// Unbaling the main instruction instead of the rdregion
/// """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
///
/// In some cases, the rdregion is in a bale that also contains another
/// rdregion of the same big vector. Unbaling the two rdregions separately
/// would create two extra instructions. We can reduce that to one extra
/// instruction by instead unbaling the main instruction from the wrregion at
/// the head, so only the wrregion is left at its original position in the code
/// and the rest of the bale is moved up.
///
/// The pass only does that if it detects more than one use of the big vector
/// in the bale.
///
/// When trying to do this, and the proposed sub-bale needs to be moved rather
/// than just unbaled, we may see that not all outside-bale operands are
/// defined before the original two address instruction. In that case, we
/// abandon the attempt to unbale the main instruction, and instead go back to
/// unbaling just the rdregion, which may succeed.
///
/// Bitcasts
/// """"""""
///
/// Because GenXCoalescing does "copy coalescing" of bitcasts first, we need to
/// consider not just the rdregion uses of the input to the original two
/// address instruction, but also uses of the whole tree of bitcasts containing
/// it. Not doing that stops the optimization working when the source CM code
/// contains format() functions.
///
/// Such bitcasts may need to be moved up to just before the original two
/// address instruction, in case any use of it is moved. In fact we just move
/// the whole tree of bitcasts to just after the definition of the root of the
/// tree.  This does not worsen code quality because the bitcasts will all be
/// copy coalesced together anyway.
