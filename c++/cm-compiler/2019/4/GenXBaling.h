/// GenXBaling
/// ----------
/// 
/// GenX instruction baling is the process of determining which LLVM instructions
/// can be combined into a single vISA instruction. Such a group of LLVM
/// instructions is known as a *bale*. A bale typically has a *main instruction*
/// and then optionally modifiers and region instructions on the sources and
/// the destination of the main instruction. However it is possible to have a
/// bale with no main instruction, for example just a rdregion, a modifier and
/// a wrregion.
///
/// Bale example
/// ^^^^^^^^^^^^
/// 
/// .. image:: GenXDesign_bale.png
/// 
/// This example shows a bale that is pretty much as complicated as you can get in
/// a single bale. Each small blue box is an LLVM IR instruction, with arrows showing
/// how each one is used. Other than the *bale head* instruction at the top, an
/// instruction in a bale has only one use, which is within the bale.
/// 
/// The baling pass
/// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
///
/// GenX instruction baling happens in two parts:
/// 
/// 1. The GenXBaling pass sets up a map to give each Instruction
///    a *BaleInfo*, which contains a field giving the role the instruction
///    plays in its enclosing bale (main instruction, rdregion, etc), and a
///    bit vector where a bit is set if the corresponding operand of the
///    instruction is another instruction that is baled in (part of the same
///    bale).
/// 
///    GenXBaling is in fact two slightly different passes run at two different
///    times:
/// 
///    * The GenXFuncBaling pass (a FunctionPass) runs before GenXLegalization,
///      which uses it but invalidates it as it changes the code. This is known
///      as *first baling*.
/// 
///    * The GenXGroupBaling pass (a FunctionGroupPass) runs after GenXLiveness.
///      From GenXLiveness, baling information remains valid through to
///      GenXVisaFunctionWriter, since any code changes made (such as adding
///      copies where coalescing fails) either do not invalidate the analysis,
///      or the pass making the change also updates the baling analysis.
/// 
///    The GenXBaling pass also detects where an instruction is baled in to
///    another, but the instruction has other uses too. In this case it clones the
///    instruction. Thus we end up with any baled in instruction having only
///    one use (with an exception for goto/join -- see below).
/// 
///    Thus the GenXBaling pass is not a pure analysis, as it can modify the
///    code.
/// 
/// 2. Using the map set up by the GenXBaling analysis, several functions are
///    provided for use by other passes:
/// 
///    * getBaleInfo()/setBaleInfo() allow another pass to directly inspect and modify
///      the baling info for an instruction. The BaleInfo for an instruction gives:
/// 
///      - Type, the role of the instruction in the bale (e.g. it is a rdregion);
///      - a bitmap of which operands are baled into it, together with methods
///        for getting and setting the bit for a particular operand.
/// 
///    * getBaleParent() returns the instruction that the given instruction is
///      baled into, if any
/// 
///    * isBaled() says whether the given instruction is baled into anything
/// 
///    * getBaleHead() returns the instruction at the head of the bale that the
///      given instruction is baled into, which is the same as the given instruction
///      if it is not baled into anything.
/// 
///    * buildBale() takes a head instruction (one for which isBaled is false) and
///      fills out a Bale struct with a vector of BaleInst structs for all the
///      instructions in the bale, where each BaleInst contains a pointer to the
///      instruction and its BaleInfo struct (as in getBaleInfo()/setBaleInfo()).
/// 
/// Criteria for baling
/// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
/// 
/// GenXBaling implements the criteria for baling, i.e. when different LLVM IR
/// instructions can be combined into the same vISA instruction:
/// 
/// * A rdregion with a variable index can bale in an add constant (where the
///   constant is splatted if vector) that generates the index. In second baling,
///   the constant add is in fact a ``llvm.genx.add.addr`` intrinsic, because that
///   is what GenXCategory converted it to.
/// 
/// * GenXBaling is where an instruction gets recognized as a modifier, for example
///   subtract from 0 is a negate modifier. The instruction is left as it is, and
///   its modifier equivalent (e.g. ``BaleInfo::NEGMOD``) is set up in the
///   instruction's BaleInfo.
/// 
/// * SExt/ZExt are also treated as modifiers, although not always balable. See
///   below.
/// 
/// * A modifier can bale in an rdregion.
/// 
/// * A modifier can bale in another modifier in some circumstances.
/// 
/// * In particular, SExt/ZExt normally cannot bale in another modifier, but they
///   are allowed to bale in an abs modifier as a bodge to fix a problem where
///   the LLVM IR generated for ``cm_abs`` does not properly represent its
///   semantics. See ``dc93b907 GenXBaling: bodge to work around cm_abs problems``.
/// 
/// * A main instruction can bale a modifier or rdregion into each operand in some
///   circumstances:
/// 
///   - Some ALU intrinsics have region requirements, e.g. oword aligned,
///     contiguous. GenXBaling enforces those requirements by only baling in an
///     rdregion that satifies them, but only in second baling. First baling does
///     the baling anyway, as we want GenXLegalization to consider the instructions
///     as one bale as it might legalize in a way that makes the region legal for
///     the instruction.
/// 
///   - Baling an SExt/ZExt in is how we represent a vISA instruction such as
///     ``add`` with a result type different to operand type. The two operands can
///     have different types too in Gen, but vISA insists they are the same (if not
///     constant). So:
/// 
///     1. In first baling, we allow SExt/ZExt from different types to be baled in
///        to the two operands. This tends to make GenXLegalization legalize them
///        to the same vector width as the main instruction.
/// 
///     2. In second baling, we do not allow SExt/ZExt from different types (or one
///        SExt/ZExt where the other operand does not have one) to be baled in. This
///        yields a legal vISA instruction, but having done (1) also allows the
///        finalizer to fold the extend into the instruction.
/// 
///   - A raw operand (of a send or shared function intrinsic) has its own
///     restrictions -- it can bale in a rdregion, but the region has to be
///     contiguous and GRF aligned.
/// 
///   - There is special case code for where send or a shared function intrinsic
///     has a ``TWOADDR`` raw operand, one that does not appear as a vISA operand
///     in its own right but is implicitly the same register as the result. The
///     twoaddr raw operand can bale in a rdregion (with region contiguous and GRF
///     aligned) as long as the result can be baled into a wrregion with the same
///     region parameters and the same "old value" input. This represents where a
///     send or shared function intrinsic does a predicated partial write, and the
///     place it does the partial write to is a region in a vISA register.
/// 
/// * ``llvm.genx.sat`` represents floating point saturation, and is a modifier that
///   is different to the other modifiers because it is not a source modifier. A
///   saturate can bale in a main instruction or modifier or rdregion.
/// 
/// * A wrregion can do the following baling:
///   
///   - It can bale a main instruction (subject to region restrictions in second
///     baling), a saturate, a modifier or a rdregion into its "new value" input.
/// 
///   - Like rdregion, it can bale a constant add into its index operand.
/// 
/// * Anything with a predicate (wrregion, select, send, all/any, some shared
///   function intrinsics) can bale in a predicate not, and any of those things,
///   including the not, can bale in an rdpredregion to represent using e.g. an M3
///   flag to use only part of the predicate. However predicate baling is not
///   done in first baling, as GenXLegalization does not want to consider the
///   operations together.
/// 
/// * Anything with a scalar i1 condition (select, br) can bale in an all/any.
/// 
/// Baling of goto/join into br
/// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
/// 
/// The goto and join intrinsics have multiple return values, returned in a single
/// struct. One of the return values is the scalar i1 !any value that is then used
/// in a conditional branch.
/// 
/// In second baling, we want the goto/join, the extractvalue of the !any
/// result, and the conditional branch to be baled together, so we can generate
/// a single goto/join instruction.
/// 
/// However the struct result of the goto/join has other uses, the extractvalues of
/// the other results. Thus, in this special case, we have a bale where the
/// goto/join instruction inside the bale has uses other than the inside-bale use.
/// This needs special case code to handle in GenXBaling.
/// 
/// In the future it may be worth considering a generalization of this idea of a
/// bale that is not a strict tree of instructions, so that we can use LLVM IR
/// to model Gen instructions with a general result and a flag result. Currently
/// we cannot do that, which means:
/// 
/// 1. we cannot represent addc properly;
/// 
/// 2. we cannot represent any combined arithmetic-and-set-flags instruction,
///    although that is not too much of a problem as the jitter derives such an
///    instruction by folding a cmp into an arithmetic instruction.
/// 
/// Alignment requirements
/// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
/// 
/// An additional function of the second baling pass is that, when it bales a
/// raw result intrinsic into a wrregion, it marks the wrregion's LiveRange as
/// needing to be 32 aligned, and when it bales a rdregion into a raw operand in
/// an intrinsic, it marks the rdregion's input's LiveRange as needing to be 32
/// aligned. GenXCategory sets most alignment requirements, but baling in
/// a rdregion or baling a main instruction into a wrregion imposes alignment
/// requirements on the vISA register that the region is read from or written to.
