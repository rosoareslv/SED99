/**
  @file storage/perfschema/pfs_dd_version.h
  Performance schema data dictionary version.
*/

/**
  The version of the current performance_schema database schema.
  Version numbering forms a name space,
  which needs to be unique across all MySQL versions,
  even including forks.

  This version number is stored on disk in the data dictionary.
  Every time the performance_schema structure changes,
  this version number must change.

  Do not use a naive 1, 2, 3, ... N numbering scheme,
  as it requires an authoritative registry to assign numbers.
  This can not work in a distributed development environment,
  even less with forks, patches and back ports done by third parties.

  The numbering to use is the MySQL version number
  of the first MySQL version that published a given database schema.
  The format is Mmmdd with M=Major, m=minor, d=dot,
  so that MySQL 8.0.4 is encoded as 80004.

  In case of -dash version numbers, encode MySQL 8.12.34-56 as 8123456.

  Historical version number published in the data dictionary:

  1:

  Introduced in MySQL 8.0.3 by WL#7900.
  Never published in a GA version, abandoned.

  80004:

  performance_schema tables changed in MySQL 8.0.4 are
  - setup_threads (created)
  - setup_instruments (modified)
  - variables_info (modified)
  - setup_timers (removed)
  - metadata_locks (modified, added column COLUMN_NAME)
  - replication_connection_configuration (modified)
  - instance_log_resource (created)
