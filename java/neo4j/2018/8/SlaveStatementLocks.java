/**
 * Slave specific statement locks that in addition to standard functionality provided by configured delegate
 * will grab selected shared locks on master during prepareForCommit phase.
 * <p>
 * In order to prevent various indexes collisions on master during transaction commit that originate on one of the
 * slaves we need to grab same locks on {@link ResourceTypes#LABEL} and {@link ResourceTypes#RELATIONSHIP_TYPE} that
 * where obtained on origin. To be able to do that and also prevent shared locks to be propagates to master in cases of
 * read only transactions we will postpone obtaining them till we know that we participating in a
 * transaction that performs modifications. That's why we will obtain them only as
 * part of {@link #prepareForCommit(LockTracer)} call.
