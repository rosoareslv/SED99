/**
 * By default a Realm can stores all classes that extends RealmClass in a project.
 * However, if you want to restrict a Realm to contain only certain classes or want
 * to share them between a library project and an app project you specify that with
 * a RealmModule.
 * <p>
 * A RealmModule is a collection of RealmClass'es that can be combined with other
 * RealmModules to create the object schema for a Realm. This makes it easier to
 * control versioning and migration of those Realms.
 * <p>
 * A RealmModule can either be a library module or an app module. This distinction
 * is made by setting {@code library = true}. Creating a library module will prevent
 * Realm from creating the default Realm module, which would otherwise conflict with
 * same class being created by app projects.
 * <p>
 * This means that library projects are <bold>required</bold> to use library modules
 * to allow the library to work seemlessly with app code. App developers can then
 * reuse the modules exposed by the library if they want to use RealmClass'es from
 * that library.
