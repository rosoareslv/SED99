/**
 * An interface that represents the result of a {@linkplain Producer production} of type {@code T},

 * injected, you can also inject {@code Produced<T>}, which enables handling of any exceptions that
 * were thrown during the production of {@code T}.
 *
 * <p>For example: <pre><code>
 *   {@literal @}Produces Html getResponse(
 *       UserInfo criticalInfo, {@literal Produced<ExtraInfo>} noncriticalInfo) {
 *     try {
 *       return new Html(criticalInfo, noncriticalInfo.get());
