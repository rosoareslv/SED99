 * Apart from providing a hook to add new functionality, it also simplifies the {@link TcpIpConnection} and
 * {@link TcpIpConnectionManager} since the IOThreadingModel provides a separation of concerns. The TcpIpConnectManager
 * is responsible for managing connections, the IOThreadingModel is responsible for providing threads to the connections.
