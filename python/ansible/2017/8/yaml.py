DOCUMENTATION:
    inventory: yaml
    version_added: "2.4"
    short_description: Uses a specifically YAML file as inventory source.
    description:
        - "YAML based inventory, starts with the 'all' group and has hosts/vars/children entries."
        - Host entries can have sub-entries defined, which will be treated as variables.
        - Vars entries are normal group vars.
        - "Children are 'child groups', which can also have their own vars/hosts/children and so on."
        - File MUST have a valid extension, defined in configuration
    notes:
        - It takes the place of the previously hardcoded YAML inventory.
        - To function it requires being whitelisted in configuration.
    options:
        yaml_extensions:
            description: list of 'valid' extensions for files containing YAML
            type: list
            default: ['.yaml', '.yml', '.json']
EXAMPLES:
all: # keys must be unique, i.e. only one 'hosts' per group
    hosts:
        test1:
        test2:
            var1: value1
    vars:
        group_var1: value2
    children:   # key order does not matter, indentation does
        other_group:
            children:
                group_x:
                    hosts:
                        test5
            vars:
                g2_var2: value3
            hosts:
                test4:
                    ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
        last_group:
            hosts:
                test1 # same host as above, additional group membership
            vars:
                last_var: MYVALUE
